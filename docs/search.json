This is one of my motivations to start blogging, to understand more on the topics I’m interested in.\nAlso, it helps me complete the thought process of many half baked ideas. Last but not least, I want to join the vibrant community of R users, open source enthusiasts, spatial people, python lovers, linux advocates and data scientists.\n\n\n\nMy Name is Nils Ratnaweera and I’m a Research Fellow at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences. I’m an environmental engineer who love his job of working with environmental spatial data using mainly open source tools such as R, python, gdal, SQL.\n\n\n\n\n",
